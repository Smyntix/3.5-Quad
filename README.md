# 3.5-Quad
hack-club github repo for a 3.5" freetyle quad build

This build is for an analog 3.5" Freestyle quad. 
you can choose if to run it on 4s or 6s and the protocol to use.
my build is gonna be 4s and ELRS, so i'm gonna use 1804 3500kv motors and an elrs 2.4 ghz receiver.

the components you need to buy are:
-Flyfishrc Volador VX3.5 frame 
-1804 motors (3500kv for 4s and 2450kv for 6s), choose the cheapest good brand you can find as prices have skyrocheted.
-Speedybee TX800 800mw Vtx
-F4/F7 FC+ESC stack, min 30A, 20x20mm/25x25mm, should be from a known brand and preferably USB-C. Ex. GOKU GN405 30A or Speedybee F405 Mini BLS 35A
-Receiver (if needed), ex. Speedybee ELRS 2.4G Nano Receiver
-Runcam Phoenix 2 Camera/Robin 3 (cheap alternative, lower quality and bad low light performance)
-SMA VTX Antenna (should be pretty short and RHCP/LHCP based on your goggle antennas)

Also, for the build you will need some miscellaneus things:
-A good soldering iron with a small tip and a wide tip (i have the TS100 but there are cheaper ones)
-Some good solder and flux
-some threadlocker
-heatshrink
-XT630/60 connectors (based on your batteries), a capacitor and some 12/14 awg wire for the battery leads (most fc's already include all of this)
-small cable ties
-a computer with betaflight (whaterver specs and os works, some FC's have bluetooth so you can even use your phone)
